Bitmapper
=========

Assigns values to pixels in bitmap based on primality or other conditions


This is a consolidated version of my Prime BMP project.
I was playing around with printing different mathy type stuff into a bmp and looking at patterns.

For this one, the top left pixel is number 1, then it counts across the lines and down the rows.
For each value, pixels are assigned a red, green, and blue value based on whatever you want.

Around line 140 there are different functions commented out - 
You can play around and try to make some cool bitmaps, try it out!

Here's a few I made for iPhone wallpapers:
